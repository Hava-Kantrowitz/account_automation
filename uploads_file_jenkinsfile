//This jenkins file can take a file from anywhere and run it through the pipeline 
//However it only works every other time
//The fact that it works every other time is repeatable. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get it to work every time 
//The issue every other time is that a file in the Java library the unstashParam library calls does not exist 
//I'm so confused
//wtf jenkins
